# Night log — 21 September 2026

What Claude did to Dimension Cat while you slept. Newest at the bottom. Every round is a commit;
`git log` has the detail, `qa/` has the screenshots each round was checked against.

## Round 1 — the people, and white ink

**Before:** everyone in the Neighborhood wore the same red shirt. Arms hung dead straight and ended in
nothing. Feet floated ten centimetres above the ground. Shirts came up to the chin.

**Now:** every townsperson has hands (mittens with a thumb), a neck, a chest that tapers to a waist,
elbows that rest bent, and shoes flat on the ground with a toe and a heel. Clothes are layered:
jackets, striped tops, aprons, belts, buttons, scarves, satchels, backpacks, sashes on dresses, flat
caps. Faces differ in eye size, spacing, brow angle and mouth, and can have glasses, freckles,
beards or moustaches. Slim, average and stout builds. **Children** — with a child's big head and
short limbs — in the Neighborhood, on the shore, on Frosty Peak and in the Victorian town.

The reason everyone was red: each shirt colour was rolled on its own, and dice clump. Clothes now come
out of a shuffled bag per world, so no two neighbours can match.

Standing still, people breathe, shift their weight, glance around and sometimes wave.

**White ink**, one pixel wide, as you asked. It reads as chalk on paper, pops at night in the
Victorian street and in Robot City, and quietly vanishes against snow and sky.

Cost: a person is 51 meshes instead of 37; the heaviest world (Victorian) went from 2595 to 3013 draw
calls and still runs at ~78 fps in the headless benchmark (`node qa/bench.mjs`).

## Round 2 — waves, and no more slashes across the sky

Turning the ink white showed up something that was always there: the zipline, the gondola cables
and the lantern strings are a pixel wide, so the ink pass drew both their edges and they came out as
solid lines across the sky. They now stay out of the ink pass entirely (they still hide behind things
properly) and read as thin dark cables again.

People give the cat a **wave** the first time it walks up to them. Gentlemen still tip their hat.

Tests added: no two neighbours share a shirt, the children are small, everyone has hands, and a
neighbour really does lift an arm when the cat comes over. 201 checks, all green.

## Round 3 — the same picture for a third fewer draw calls

A person was 51 separate meshes; Victorian has 22 people. Every joint's static parts are now merged
into one vertex-coloured mesh at build time — a person is 20 meshes and looks identical. Then the
same was done for all sixteen creatures. Victorian went from 3013 draw calls (after round 1) to
2305; the forest from 3036 to 2889.

`node qa/bench.mjs` now measures from a fixed spot at noon so its numbers compare run to run.

## Round 4 — the town has something to do

- **Nobody walks in the road.** Strollers keep to the pavements, gardens and park; the asphalt of both
  roads is off limits, so the cars are not forever honking at pedestrians.
- **Two people sit on the park bench**, half-turned toward each other, hands in their laps, and look
  round when the cat comes past.
- **Two children play tag on the east lawn.** One is "it" and chases; the other runs, weaving. When
  caught, the tagged one hops and becomes "it", counts to three, and the chase goes the other way.
  A little rising blip plays on every tag.

Tests: none of the strollers is standing in the road, the sitters' knees are bent, and the children
swap roles (four times in twenty seconds) without leaving the lawn. `node qa/park.mjs` shoots it.

## Round 5 — hellos, and a dog on a lead

- When someone waves at the cat they now **say something** on the HUD: the Neighborhood has its own
  lines ("Aww, who's a good cat?"), so do the Victorian town ("A cat about town! How very modern."),
  the shore ("Careful, the sand's hot!") and the peak ("Have you seen the yeti? He's lovely."), and
  children have theirs everywhere ("Can we keep it?"). Never more than one line every six seconds.
- **A woman walks her dog** up and down the north pavement. The dog trots at her heel on a lead that
  stretches from her hand to its collar, and woofs now and then.

## Round 6 — a snowball fight

Two of the children on Frosty Peak are having a **snowball fight** across the village square: they
wind up, throw, the snowball arcs over and bursts in a puff of snow, and whoever it hits flinches.
They shuffle about between throws. Walk the cat up close and one of them will throw one at *you* —
"Got you, kitty!" — once per visit.

## Round 7 — a beach ball, a paper boy, and voices

- On Sunny Shore **two of the sunbathers keep the beach ball up**: held a moment, thrown in a high
  arc, caught, thrown back. Stand right next to the catcher and it comes down off the cat's head with
  a "Boing!" and hops on to them.
- The Victorian **urchin sells papers**: "Extra! Extra! Cat seen in town!", "Paper, guv'nor?
  Ha'penny!" — called out now and then when the cat is within earshot.
- Every greeting and cry now has a little **talk blip** with it; the beach ball has a soft bounce.
- `qa/bench.mjs` covers Frosty Peak too. All six worlds sit at 300–2900 draw calls and ~90 fps.

## Round 8 — elders, skipping children, and a cane

People now bend from the waist rather than tipping over whole: there is a spine joint at the hips.
About one adult in six is an **elder** — grey or white hair, more often in glasses, a little stooped,
a shade shorter. The two on the park bench are elders now and lean back into it. **Children skip**
when they walk, a hop on every step. Anyone with a **cane** keeps it planted ahead, takes shorter
steps and sways; the Victorian gentlemen with canes go slower, and the paper boy runs.

## Round 9 — a swing, and a ring dance

- A blue **swing set** stands in the park west of the path, and a girl swings on it, kicking her
  legs out at the top of each arc. "Wheee!" when the cat is near.
- In Candy Land four **gingerbread men dance a ring** round the big green lollipop, hand in hand,
  turning about every nine seconds.

## Round 10 — robots at work, a hiker, a bobby

- In Robot City a **loader robot** stands at the end of each conveyor and lifts every crate off as it
  arrives, with a beep, next to the stack it has already unloaded.
- A **hiker** with a backpack walks the stepping stones in Whisper Woods, from the hollow oak to the
  glade and back, and tells you the fairies come out at dusk.
- A **bobby** in a tall helmet patrols the Victorian street, up one side and down the other:
  "'Ello 'ello, what's all this then?"

## Round 11 — the lamplighter

An old **lamplighter** in a flat cap works his way along the Victorian street, lamp to lamp, zig-
zagging across the cobbles. At each one he stops, raises his glowing pole and the lamp flares
brighter for a moment. "Another one lit. Only forty to go." The dog on the lead in the
Neighborhood can now be petted, like the one on the beach.

## Round 12 — "Say hello", and the country baked

- Walk up to anyone and press **E: "Say hello"** (or "Say hi" to a child). They wave — a gentleman
  tips his hat — say their line, and hearts go up.
- The generated country outside each world's centre was 70–80% of what the game drew each frame.
  Every static prop out there is now baked into a single mesh as it is placed: Candy Land draws 866
  calls where it drew 1455, Frosty Peak 1911 instead of 2605, the woods 1551 instead of 2342. It
  looks the same.

## Round 13 — sunbathers, a sandcastle, and a push

- Two **sunbathers** lie flat out on the beach towels in dark glasses, hands behind their heads.
- A **child kneels at the sandcastle**, patting the sand, bucket at hand.
- Walk up to the park swing and press **E: "Push the swing"** — she goes higher for a while.

## Round 14 — a balloon of your own

A **balloon seller** stands just south of the park path with a bunch of six. Press **E: "Take a
balloon"** and one is tied to the cat: it floats above and a little behind, drifting after you, and it
comes with you **through every portal**. Press E again to swap colours. "Balloons! Get your
balloons!"

## Round 15 — the post

A **postie** with a satchel does the round of every mailbox on the main street — the south side
east, the north side west, then round again — stopping at each to post the letters. "Letter for
number twelve!"

## Round 16 — a cyclist

A woman in a yellow cap **rides a green bicycle** round and round the main street in the westbound
lane, pedalling, leaning into the bars. Like the cars she stops for the cat — but rings her bell
instead of honking.

## Round 17 — a horse and carriage

A **horse and carriage** clip-clops east along the Victorian street and round again, lanterns lit,
a top-hatted driver on the box with the reins. It stops for the cat like everything else on the
road. The balloon now floats at the right height whatever shape you are in.

## Round 18 — a kite

A boy on the dunes of Sunny Shore **flies a red and yellow kite**: it swoops in a lazy figure of
eight ten metres up, tail streaming, on a line from his hands. "Higher than the lighthouse!"

## Round 19 — a sled run

On the flank of the west peak a girl **sleds down a twelve-metre drop**, arms in the air —
"Wheeeee!" — skids to a stop in a puff of snow, then trudges back up dragging the sled behind her
on a rope, and goes again.

## Round 21 — a woodcutter, and the Queen's guard

- A stout, bearded **woodcutter** stands at the stump by the forest glade splitting logs: the axe
  goes up over his head and comes down with a thunk and a spray of chips. "Mind the chips, puss."
- **Three gingerbread guards** march in step back and forth in front of the Candy Queen: "Hup, two,
  three, four!" — "Halt! ...who goes there? Oh, a kitty."
