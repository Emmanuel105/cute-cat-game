# Night log — 21 September 2026

What Claude did to Dimension Cat while you slept. Newest at the bottom. Every round is a commit;
`git log` has the detail, `qa/` has the screenshots each round was checked against.

## Round 1 — the people, and white ink

**Before:** everyone in the Neighborhood wore the same red shirt. Arms hung dead straight and ended in
nothing. Feet floated ten centimetres above the ground. Shirts came up to the chin.

**Now:** every townsperson has hands (mittens with a thumb), a neck, a chest that tapers to a waist,
elbows that rest bent, and shoes flat on the ground with a toe and a heel. Clothes are layered:
jackets, striped tops, aprons, belts, buttons, scarves, satchels, backpacks, sashes on dresses, flat
caps. Faces differ in eye size, spacing, brow angle and mouth, and can have glasses, freckles,
beards or moustaches. Slim, average and stout builds. **Children** — with a child's big head and
short limbs — in the Neighborhood, on the shore, on Frosty Peak and in the Victorian town.

The reason everyone was red: each shirt colour was rolled on its own, and dice clump. Clothes now come
out of a shuffled bag per world, so no two neighbours can match.

Standing still, people breathe, shift their weight, glance around and sometimes wave.

**White ink**, one pixel wide, as you asked. It reads as chalk on paper, pops at night in the
Victorian street and in Robot City, and quietly vanishes against snow and sky.

Cost: a person is 51 meshes instead of 37; the heaviest world (Victorian) went from 2595 to 3013 draw
calls and still runs at ~78 fps in the headless benchmark (`node qa/bench.mjs`).

## Round 2 — waves, and no more slashes across the sky

Turning the ink white showed up something that was always there: the zipline, the gondola cables
and the lantern strings are a pixel wide, so the ink pass drew both their edges and they came out as
solid lines across the sky. They now stay out of the ink pass entirely (they still hide behind things
properly) and read as thin dark cables again.

People give the cat a **wave** the first time it walks up to them. Gentlemen still tip their hat.

Tests added: no two neighbours share a shirt, the children are small, everyone has hands, and a
neighbour really does lift an arm when the cat comes over. 201 checks, all green.

## Round 3 — the same picture for a third fewer draw calls

A person was 51 separate meshes; Victorian has 22 people. Every joint's static parts are now merged
into one vertex-coloured mesh at build time — a person is 20 meshes and looks identical. Then the
same was done for all sixteen creatures. Victorian went from 3013 draw calls (after round 1) to
2305; the forest from 3036 to 2889.

`node qa/bench.mjs` now measures from a fixed spot at noon so its numbers compare run to run.

## Round 4 — the town has something to do

- **Nobody walks in the road.** Strollers keep to the pavements, gardens and park; the asphalt of both
  roads is off limits, so the cars are not forever honking at pedestrians.
- **Two people sit on the park bench**, half-turned toward each other, hands in their laps, and look
  round when the cat comes past.
- **Two children play tag on the east lawn.** One is "it" and chases; the other runs, weaving. When
  caught, the tagged one hops and becomes "it", counts to three, and the chase goes the other way.
  A little rising blip plays on every tag.

Tests: none of the strollers is standing in the road, the sitters' knees are bent, and the children
swap roles (four times in twenty seconds) without leaving the lawn. `node qa/park.mjs` shoots it.
